# Microservices

A microservice that make a request to another microservice and store their data into storage for caching

- API A: python-service
- API B: rust-service

I made the rust-service like a service maded from another person, like if i don't know very well

The api A make a request to api B and store the value from api B into databases in the layer of api A.
If already have a request to something that already have proccessed, will return the cached value from database
